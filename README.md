## About

MINIFI is a playful, story-driven gateway to DeFi savings, built for beginners, creators, and anyone hesitant about decentralized finance. Instead of charts and jargon, users grow their savings by feeding and caring for adorable digital creatures called **Turriteccos**, each a yield-generating NFT powered by Unlock and Aave Protocol.

**Through MINIFI, anyone can:**
- Mint and feed their own Turritecco, with each feeding depositing tokens into Aave and generating yield safely in the background.
- Track progress visually and transparently, developing healthy savings habits—one micro-investment at a time.
- Enjoy seamless onboarding as a Farcaster Mini App and a standalone platform, making DeFi accessible through social and community channels.
- Experience **The ALANA Project** storytelling, with each creature rooted being part of its creative universe.

## The MINIFI Difference

While other NFT, DeFi, and "gamefi" apps focus on trading, speculation, or simulation, MINIFI is about calm, creative, and confidence-building financial growth. It transforms DeFi into something caring, approachable, and habit-forming—making yield generation safe, visual, and fun.
