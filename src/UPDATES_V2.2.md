## ðŸŽ¨ Link Styling

All links feature consistent styling:
- **Color**: `#DCC2FE` (MINIFI's digital lavender)

- **Attributes**: `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security

### Link Classes
```tsx
className="text-[#DCC2FE] hover:text-[#DCC2FE]/80 underline

inline-flex items-center gap-1"
```
